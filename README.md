# Divengine Prioriza Python Lib

**prioriza** is the official Python implementation of the [Prioriza Method](https://github.com/rafageist/prioriza),  
a general multi-criteria decision-making and prioritization framework.

The method defines how to evaluate and order elements that compete under several
parameters, using a system of levels, weights, and leveled tables.  
It supports:

- **Discrete Prioriza** (integer priority levels)  
- **Continuous Prioriza** (continuous values mapped to priority functions)  
- Built-in prioritization strategies:
  - survival
  - quality
  - strongest
  - exporter

This repository contains the implementation and usage examples.  
The full theoretical foundation is available separately in the repository:

## 🚧 Project Status

This library is currently under active development.  
A first stable API will be released once the full theory is finalized.
